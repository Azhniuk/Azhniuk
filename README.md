# Hi there! I'm Sofi 👋

## 🧠 Who am I?

I am a Computer Systems student. I am also into 3D printing 🧙‍♀️, bringing digital designs to life with my trusty printer under the brand Pixel3D.

## 🎯 What do I do?

- **Code**: Writing Python scripts that (mostly) work. My focus is on AI, computer vision, and making SQL queries.
- **Teach**: English tutor, programming mentor, and somehow surviving teaching people with zero English knowledge (send help). 🆘
- **3D Print**: Bones? Prototypes? Maybe something cursed? You name it, I'll print it.
- **Plast Leader**: Guiding young minds in the Ukrainian scouting world and hoping they don't set anything on fire. 🔥


## 💻 Tech Stack

```python
languages = ["Python", "SQL", "C++"]
databases = ["PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]
soft_skills = ["Patience", "Creativity", "Explaining Past Simple 1000 times"]
```

- Yes, I will 3D print you something cool (for the right price 💸).
