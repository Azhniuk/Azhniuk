# Hi there! I'm Sofi 👋

## 🧠 Who am I?

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Vision & AI student. I also moonlight as a 3D printing wizard 🧙‍♀️, bringing digital designs to life with my trusty printer under brand **Pixel3D**.

## 🎯 What do I do?

- **Code**: Writing Python scripts that (mostly) work. My focus is on AI, computer vision, and making SQL queries.
- **Teach**: English tutor, programming mentor, and somehow surviving teaching people with zero English knowledge (send help). 🆘
- **3D Print**: Bones? Cool bookmarks? Maybe something cursed? You name it, I'll print it.
- **Plast Leader**: Guiding young minds in the Ukrainian scouting world and hoping they don't set anything on fire. 🔥

## 🚀 Current Missions

- Writing my Bachelor thesis (totally not procrastinating, I swear 🤞)
- Growing **Pixel3D** 🏰
- Mastering Lithuanian & Latvian (because learning easy languages is boring)

## 💻 Tech Stack

```python
languages = ["Python", "SQL", "C++"]
databases = ["PostgreSQL", "MySQL"]
tools = ["PyTorch", "OpenCV", "Matplotlib"]
soft_skills = ["Patience", "Creativity", "Explaining Past Simple 1000 times"]
```

- Yes, I will 3D print you something cool (for the right price 💸).
